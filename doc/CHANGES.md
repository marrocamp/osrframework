- Inclusions of email verification transforms.
- Inclusion of a call to pipl.com API.
- Full normalization of fields.
- Create Facesaerch and Tor search transforms in Maltego.
- Recover the logging functions.

[Known issues]
- Text to deep web search is broken.
- Recursive expansion of attributes when the cap is reached in Maltego.
- There is an issue in Maltego Chlorine CE when exporting a transform with the transform.local.parameters popup marked as True: <Property name="transform.local.parameters" type="string" popup="true"></Property>. However, when importing the created .mtz file the popup attribute is not correctly updated not requesting the user who imported the transform the value unless he/she clicks on configure and manually update this value, something which may not be trivial for some users. This issue affects the transform aliasToSelectedPlatforms which will throw an error if not manually configured by the user instead of asking the user to insert the deliberately missing parameters. This is not an OSRFramework issue and has conveniently be notified to Paterva with date of 2015/08/12.
