Frequent Asked Questions
========================

In this section, we will try to address some of the most common questions we have heard about the platform.
Anyway, if the issue is not listed here, feel free to (report an issue)[https://github.com/i3visio/osrframework/issues/new].

Installation and Deployment Issues
----------------------------------

# Can I install OSRFramework in my Windows machine?

Yes, you can. 
You still need to download (Python 2)[https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2715/] from the official website.
Make sure that you click on `Add python.exe to the system path`.
Then, check that Python is reachable typing `python.exe --version` in a CMD. 
The output should look like this:

```
Python 2.7.15
```

If this is not the case and Python is not recognised, you can follow (these steps)[https://superuser.com/questions/143119/how-do-i-add-python-to-the-windows-path].

You can then proceed as follows installing OSRFramework:

```
pip install osrframework
```

After a while, `usufy`, `mailfy` and the rest of the tools will be reachable.

# Why there is no support to Python 3?

Moving to Python 3 is in our inmediate roadmap, but it cannot be fixed until we remove the `mechanize` dependency which is only available under Python 2.
However, this will be addressed in future versions of OSRFramework.

General Usage Questions
-----------------------

# I see some false positives whenever I launch usufy -n my_nick -p all. What can I do to remove the non-working wrappers?

You have two options:

- **Excluding manually with each call**. You can do it by manually appending `-x facebook` or `--exclude facbeook` to exclude the Facebook wrapper. 
- **Excluding them using the configuration file**. In the `general.cfg` file you can specify which platforms to exclude on each call. In GNU/Linux systems and MacOS machines the file can be found in `~/.config/OSRFramework`. In Windows systems, in the home folder of the user `<USER_HOME>/OSRFramework`. The file is a text file which can be edited with any text editor. The only lines to change are the last ones so as to set the  `exclude_platforms` to any list of space-separated list of wrappers. For instance, if you needed to exclude the Facebook and Instagram platforms you will have to set the `exclude_platforms` by typing `exclude_platforms = facebook instagram`. Remember that lines starting with a `#` are not interpreted and are provided as examples.

```
â€¦
# Platforms to be manually excluded
exclude_platforms = facebook instagram
#exclude_platforms = twitter skype
```

# How can I export the results to an Excel file directly?

Although by default OSRFramework creates a `csv` file, you can always export the results to `xls`. `xlsx` or other formats. You can do it by launching it with the option `-e` or `--extension`:

```
usufy -n i3visio -p twitter -e xls gml csv
```

This command will create three different files in the current folder: `profiles.csv`, `profiles.gml` and `profiles.xls`.

# How can I open the results in the browser?

To open the found profiles in a web browser so as to perform a manual analysis, just use `-w` or `--web_browser`. For example:

```
usufy -n i3visio -p twitter -w
```
